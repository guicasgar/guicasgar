- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Economics, Financial, Statistics, Data, Geographic Information Systems, Philosophy and Psycology
- 🌱 I'm in the middle of a master's program in Executive Data Analysis and Big Data, aiming to shake things up in my career. So, I'll be sharing exercises and projects to showcase both what I already know and what I'm learning. Let's see if I can put together a cool portfolio. And of course, if you want to pitch in or spot any mistakes in my code, feel free to give me a heads up.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Analytics projects
